## Methods and Motivation

This project has evolved over the course of the semester we spent working on it. The initial motivations and scopes we envisioned quickly changed, so here we will discuss where it started, where it ended, and where it will go from here. We will also delve into the techniques and solutions we found to our various problems along with the reasoning behind them.
